# Refactored Payroll

 ## Strategy
 
  This pattern was applied in [Functionalities_Employee.java](https://github.com/Tayco110/Payroll/blob/main/Payroll/src/functionalities/Functionalities_Employee.java), to solve    the problem of multiple methods, with the same purpose, accumulated in the same class. And decrease the amount of conditional functions.
